1. For the Physical Server I purchase a SFF Lenovo Thinkcentre M910q with a i5-6500T 2.50GHz (upto 3.10GHz), 16GB Ram and a 1TB m.2 SSD.

2. I then created a bootable stick to install Proxmox, Once the bootable stick was created I proceeded to install Truenas for file management.

3. I then created a Container that runs Portainer and from Portainer I spun up an Pihole instance so that I could use it as my DNS.

4. As of 1/09/24 I'm currently working on installing PFSense to use as a firewall, then I will be installing an open source Siem like Wazuh.
